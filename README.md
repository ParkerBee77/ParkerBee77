- 👋 Hi, I’m @ParkerBee77
- 👀 I’m interested in crypto currency exchange, the innovation & interest it has brought to the next generation of technology developers as well as users, the ideas being created, the linking of these separate ideas, hopefully creating a better world for future generations without impoverished communities or basic needs being met for a wealthier global community. I hope to see an end to homelessness, hunger, children without shoes or education someday because of it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become more involved with the crypto community by testing some of the ideas & applications for an end consumer product, hackathons, applied use for these developments & the potential adoption of them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ease of use for emerging products & ideas, to test or attempt "breaking" to expose weak points or vulnerabilities a typical consumer (or a click curious with too much time & not enough experience or guidance) would encounter.
- 📫 How to reach me best is direct message via social, @ParkerBee77 Twitter, @BeeParks telegram, utahpeojectpros@gmail.com, then by cell phone & there would be extensive interaction to obtain that info unless really searched for the ultra curious.
